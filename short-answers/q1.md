# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
Using async/await can be written in sychronous-like manner, meaning it can read similarly to synchronous code allowing great readability. You can also avoid using many callbacks and the mistakes that come with them altogether. Another great addition to using async/await is using 'try/catch' which is a general purpose way to handle errors.
